# E-commerce-back-end
my motivation for this project was to create a pathway for information that can be shown through Insomnia. I built this so show my skills of creating a database with the mysql, express, dotenv, and sequlize. This solves how data can be added or deleted from a database for new or old information. What I learn with this project was building a Database for any type of website with the tools like sequlize and mysql. For the problems I ran into were with the .env file and having it connect with the my sql application.
